# Which-messanger-should-you-pick-and-why
Many people have asked this question but have never gave a proper documentation on it. People tell you to choose this or choose that and it's not well documented. So today I am gonna try to document each messenger, why you should pick them and the threat model associated. Along with each how private they are, 

## Why is open source so wanted and why your privacy friends recommend you use open source application.

Jus as the title says, Many privacy people will tell you to pick open source apps. What is open source? It is when the code of the app is shown to the public when it is posted on server available to access via thr internet. Some website host the code of open source projects like github,GitLab,Codeberg etc. Of cource some times people make their own git server. Basically you can see the code of the project if you google search it.

## The common misconception of open source between the common people
People think that when an app is open source, it is sceptible to hackers more. This is wrong. Open source means ths app can be seen by everyone and when people find bugs, they help in fixing it by contributing to the project. So it is secure by design. And close sourcing isn't gonna make an app more secure. This is the case with windows. Even though it is closed source, it is not secure at all and is sceptible to malware. And one more misconception, Open source apps are not always secure. Think aout it, thousands of open source projects are there and many more are being made. who in their right mind has the timr to check the source code of each application. Or a large project like linux, How will you find a way to check the source code of the whole kernel. No matter how you see it, its extremely difficult. So no, open source apps are not always secure.

## What are security audits and why should I care when an open source app gets audited?
An audit is a security cehck done by third party to see whether the code is secure and not having bugs or major flaws. It helps in identifying issues in the code and also tells us normal people how secure the code is. It is like your buddy that checks the source code and tells you that you can use the app and say its secure.
